# Governance Process

This section will contain all parts of Tinyman Governance: Creating a Proposal, Proposal Voting, and Proposal Execution. All activities will take place on the blockchain and will require transaction signing.

## Proposal Creating

This is actually the main step of the Governance Proposal: on-chain proposal and subsequent voting. To submit an on-chain proposal, the proposer must have a minimum TINY Power to his address and must publish a Governance forum post with a summary of the earlier discussions, the poll results from the forum, the proposal itself, and the proposal’s action.

* At this stage, a Proposal Template with the following details will be provided for creating a proposal and submitting it.&#x20;
  * Title
  * Category
  * Governance Forum URL
  * Governance Forum Poll
  * Description
* Proposals must belong to one of the listed categories. The number and variety of categories will increase over time. Initial Categories:
  * Tinyman Protocol — Fee Structure
  * $TINY Token - Rewards (Governance, Farming, etc.)
  * Tinyman - Governance
  * Grants
  * Tinyman Analytics
  * Etc.
  * _Note: We will provide a proposal template and placeholders for each category._&#x20;
* The proposal should defend something very clearly and urge the governors to agree or disagree with it. (For or Against, Yes or No, etc.)
  * There will also be a 3rd option that allows users who are undecided or dislike the proposal to veto the vote. (Veto or Abstention)
* After the proposal is submitted by the owner, Tinyman team will check its eligibility. E.g.
  * Is the Discussion Forum URL valid and includes the associated discussion.&#x20;
  * Is the Forum Poll URL valid and confirms that the early offer has been approved by the majority?
  * Is the content of the proposal convenient with the specified category?
  * etc.
  * _Note: All these rules will be clearly expressed and public in the Forum._
* Once the moderators approve the proposal, it will be listed in the Tinyman Governance Portal. Two days before the voting starts, the proposal will be reviewed.&#x20;
* _Note: The amount or percentage of the threshold should be configurable with Governance proposals._

## Proposal Voting

After the review process is over, everyone will have 7 days to vote. This is an on-chain process and governors have to connect their wallets to Governance Portal and validate their positions in the Governance vault. The proposal requires at least 2.25 million "YES" votes in Tiny Power to pass.

**Details**;

* Users need to sign a transaction and this transaction will be tracked/recorded on the blockchain.
* It is an irreversible activity: users vote once and it's over.
* The governors will affect the voting result as much as the voting power they have.&#x20;
