### Overview

The Tinyman V2 contracts consist of a single stateful smart contract (the **Validator App**) and a template for a stateless smart contract for each Pool, the **Pool LogicSig**. The Validator app is created/deployed to the network by the Tinyman team. The Pool contract accounts are created from the Pool LogicSig template by the first Pooler who wishes to provide liquidity. Pool contract account addresses are discovered or verified by Swappers/Poolers using the Pool LogicSig template to generate a specific Pool LogicSig and retrieving the address.
