# Governance Rewards

* Staking TINY tokens in the governance vault allows users to earn staking rewards on an ongoing basis. (Stake $TINY, Earn $TINY)
* Longer commitments will result in higher TINY Power, which will be rewarded more.&#x20;
  * The rewards will be distributed to the governors based on their shares in locked tokens.
  * These structures are designed to encourage long-term participation in the governance process.
* There will be a fixed amount of TINY tokens allocated each week for 4 years to be distributed to governors under this initiative.&#x20;
  * 1st Year – 1000K TINY Token per Week
  * 2nd Year – 900K TINY Token per Week
  * 3rd Year – 700K TINY Token per Week
* Tokens will be unlocked in weekly cycles
  * Users will receive the rewards based on their share of total locked tokens in the Governance vault. (TINY Power)
  * Rewards are distributed daily and can be claimed on a weekly basis.
  * Governors can claim the Governance Rewards they are qualified for at any time.
