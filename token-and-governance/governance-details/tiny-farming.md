# TINY Farming

The Tinyman Governance system enables voting on the distribution of $TINY as farming rewards. Tinyman Governors will vote on monthly governance proposals  and determine which pool will receive the most rewards that month. TINY tokens will be distributed to LPs through these Tinyman Farms.

### Structure:

*



### **Rewards Distribution:**&#x20;

* Protocol Share: 20% to fixed pools (e.g. ALGO/USDC, TINY/ALGO and TINY/USDC)&#x20;
* Community Share: 80% to all pools based on community vote.

### **Workflow**:

* Every month, voting will be available for the next month. (E.g. 20th day of the month)
* Voting duration will last for 7 days
* During the voting period, users are given an interface to choose which pools they want to see on farming
* The pools that receive the most votes from the community at the end of the duration are selected for the farming initiative with their reward allocations for the next month
