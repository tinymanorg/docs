**TINY Token Allocations**: 1 billion TINY will be available in total and become accessible over the course of 4 years. The initial four-year allocation is as follows:

* 30.00% to Investors with 10% upfront, 1-year lock period, and 18-month linear vesting
* 15.00% to Team members with 1-year cliff and 2-year linear vesting
* 20.00% to Protocol treasury and grants with 1-year cliff and 2-year linear vesting
* 35.00% to Community members with 4-year vesting

## Distribution Details

* With the token creation event, all investors will receive a 10% upfront payment and Tinyman Treasury will receive a 15% upfront payment.
* All investors and Tinyman Treasury are subject to a one-year cliff period. During this period, stakeholders are not entitled to receive tokens. After one year, the remaining amount will be automatically distributed monthly.
  * 12 months cliff, then 18 months linear vesting for the Investors
  * 12 months cliff, then 24 months linear vesting for Tinyman Treasury
* Community will start earning TINY Rewards through 2 different channels for 4 years:
  * Governance Rewards: Users who lock their $TINYs to Tinyman Governance Vault will qualify for TINY Power. This Power will determine users to earn rewards from Governance Vault and also empower users on Governance Voting.
  * Liquidity Mining Rewards – Tinyman Governors will vote on governance proposals monthly and determine which pool will receive the most rewards that month. TINY tokens will be distributed to LPs through these Tinyman Farms.



## Token Generation Event

13.25% of the Token Supply will be in circulation on day 1. (\~132.5M $TINY)

* 30,050M – Investors (22.68% of initial allocation)
* 32,925M – Tinyman Treasury (24.85% of initial allocation)
* 69,500M – Community Airdrop (52.46% of initial allocation)

_Note: Investors or Tinyman Treasury will not be able to vest any tokens within one year of the Token Generation Event. The only way new tokens will be released into circulation for the first 12 months is through community rewards: Governance Rewards and Liquidity Mining Rewards._
