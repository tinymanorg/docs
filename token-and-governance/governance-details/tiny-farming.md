# TINY Farming

The Tinyman Governance system enables voting on the distribution of $TINY as farming rewards. Tinyman Governors will vote on monthly governance proposals  and determine which pool will receive the most rewards that month. TINY tokens will be distributed to LPs through these Tinyman Farms.

### Workflow:

* Farming proposals will be listed automatically on 17th or 18th of every month. &#x20;
* Voting begins on the 20th of each month and lasts 7 days.
* During the voting period, users are presented with an interface where they can choose which pools they would like to see in farming, and users will vote based on the TINY Power they hold.
* The pools that receive the most votes (top 60 pools) from the community at the end of the duration are selected for the farming initiative with their reward allocations for the next month.

### **Rewards Distribution:**&#x20;

* Protocol Share: 20% to fixed pools (e.g. ALGO/USDC, TINY/ALGO and TINY/USDC)&#x20;
* Community Share: 80% to all pools based on community vote. (proportionally)
